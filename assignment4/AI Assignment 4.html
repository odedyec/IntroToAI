<h2> Programming assignment - Reasoning under uncertainty  </h2>
<h2>Hurricane Evacuation Problem: Locate the Blockages and Evacuees</h2>
        </center>
<p>

</p><h3>Goals </h3>
<p>
Probabilistic reasoning using 
Bayes networks, with scenarios similar to the
hurricane evacuation problem environment of assignment 1.

</p><h3>Uncerain Hurricane Evacuation Problem - Domain Description</h3>

<p>

As they try to find their best path, in the real world, evacuation forces may be unable
to tell in advance what which road are blocked and where are there people to be evacuated, if any.
There may be evidence which can help, but one cannot be sure until
the node and or edge in question is reached! Not knowing the blockages and
evacuee contents in advance makes it hard
to plan an optimal path, so reasoning about the unknown is crucial.
We know that it is more likely for people to need evacuation near blocked roads,
and roads are more likely to be blocked if there is evidence of flooding at adjacent vertices.
In this version of the problem, we will consider only binary-valued occupation
of vertices, i.e. whether it contains people to be evacuated, or not.
</p><p>

Thus we have a binary random variable Fl(v)
standing in for "flooding" at vertex v,
one binary random variable Ev(v) standing in for "people to evacuate" at each vertex v,
and a binary variable B(e) standing in for "blocked" for each edge e.
The flooding events are assumed independent, with known distributions.
The blockages are noisy-or distributed given the flooding at incident vertices,
with pi =(1-qi)= 0.6*1/w(e). There are people at vertex v, with noisy or distributions given all the
edge blockages at all edges incident on v, with pi = 0.8 for an edge with weight greater then
4, and with pi=0.4 for shorter edges..

</p><p>
All in all, you have 3 types of variables (BN nodes): blockages (one for each edge)
flooding (one for each vertex,) and evacuees present (one for each vertex).
</p><p>

In your program, a file specifies the geometry (graph), and parameters such as P(Fl(v)=true)).
Then, you enter some locations where flooding, blockages, or evacuees are 
reported either present or absent (and the rest remain unknown).
This is the evidence in the problem.

Once evidence is instantiated, you need to perform reasoning about the likely locations of 
flooding, blockages, and evacuees:

</p><ol>
<li> What is the probability that each of the vertices contains evacuees?
</li><li> What is the probability that each of the vertices is flooded?
</li><li> What is the probability that each of the edges is blocked?
</li><li> What is the probability that a certain path (set of edges) is free from blockages?
(Note that the distributions of blockages in edges are NOT necessarily independent.)
</li><li> What is the path from a given location to a goal that has the highest probability of
being free from blockages? (bonus)
</li></ol>

<p>
Input can be as an ASCII
file, similar to graph descriptions in previous assignments, for example:

</p><pre>#V 4          ; number of vertices n in graph (from 1 to n)

#V 1 F 0.2    ; Vertex 1, probability flooding 0.2
#V 2 F 0.4    ; Vertex 2, probability flooding 0.4
              ; Either assume flooding probability 0 by default,
              ; or make sure to specify this probability for all vertices.

#E1 1 2 W1 ; Edge1 between vertices 1 and 2, weight 1
#E2 2 3 W3 ; Edge2 between vertices 2 and 3, weight 3
#E3 3 4 W3 ; Edge3 between vertices 3 and 4, weight 3
#E4 2 4 W4 ; Edge4 between vertices 2 and 4, weight 4
</pre>


<p>
 
</p><h3>Requirements </h3>

<p>
(Part I) Your program should read the data, including the distribution
parameters, which are defined as above.
The program should construct a Bayes network according
to the scenario.
The program should also allow for an output of the Bayes network constructed
for the scenario.

</p><p>
For example, part of the output for the above graph,  would be:
</p><pre>
VERTEX 1:
  P(Flooding) = 0.2
  P(not Flooding) = 0.8

  P(Evacuees|Blockage 1) = 0.6
  P(Evacuees|not Blockage 1) = 0
  P(not Evacuees|Blockage 1) = 0.4
  P(not Evacuees|not Blockage 1) = 1

VERTEX 2:
etc.

EDGE 1:
  P(Blocakge 1 | not flooding 1, not flooding 2) = 0
  P(Blocakge 1 | flooding 1, not flooding 2) = 0.4
  P(Blocakge 1 | not flooding 1, flooding 2) = 0.4
  P(Blocakge 1 | flooding 1, flooding 2) = 0.64
etc,

</pre>

<p>
(Part II) You should then query the
user for a set of evidence. We do this
by reading one piece of evidence at a time (e.g. "Flood reported at vertex 2", and then
"Evacuees reported at vertex 1" etc.).
The online interactive operations your program  should support are:
<il>
</il></p><li> Reset evidence list to empty.
</li><li> Add piece of evidence to evidence list.
</li><li> Do probabilistic reasoning (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, whichever your program supports) 
and report the results.
</li><li> Quit.


<p>
Probabilistic reasoning should be done
in order to answer the questions on
distribution of blockages, etc., and report on the answers,
including all the posterior probabilities. 

You may use any algorithm in the literature that supports solution of
BNs, including simple enumerarion,
variable elimination, polytree propagation, or sampling.


</p><h3>Deliverables </h3>

<ol>
<li> Source code and executable files of programs.
</li><li> Explanation of the method for constructing the BN and your
reasoning algorithm.
</li><li> Non-trivial example runs on at least 2 scenarios,
including the input and output.
</li><li> Submit makefile and short description on how to run your program.
 i.e. how what  parameters are passed to the program and how 
other inputs including 
at least one full example on how to run your program with actual input.
</li></ol>
